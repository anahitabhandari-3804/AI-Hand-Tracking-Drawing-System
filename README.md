# 🖐️ AI Hand Gesture Drawing System

This project enables **drawing using hand gestures**, powered by **AI**!  
It uses **MediaPipe Hands, OpenCV, and NumPy** to recognize finger movements, detect shapes, and allow gesture-based controls.

## 📌 About the Project  

This **AI-powered hand gesture drawing system** allows users to draw on a digital canvas using only their hands.  
Using a webcam, the system tracks hand movements and enables interaction through gestures such as:  
- **Moving a finger to draw**  
- **Making a fist to stop drawing**  
- **Giving a thumbs-up to erase**  
- **Touching the thumb and index finger to change colors**  
- **Sketching rough circles, squares, or triangles and having them automatically corrected**  

The system works in **real-time** and displays both the **webcam feed** and **drawing canvas** side by side.  
This makes it perfect for **digital whiteboarding, AI-powered sketching, and gesture-based interaction**!
